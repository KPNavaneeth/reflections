1)What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A)To initialise a repository we use (git init ) and use ( git status ) to see if commits are made.
When we initialise a repository we have a repository with empty commits . And only untracked files are present in the directory .

*/To add changes to the intermediate staging area ?
We use ( git add filename ) and use ( git status ) to see change .
You can also remove a file from staging area using ( git reset filename ) */

2)How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A)Staging area is an intermediate stage where you can add files that you woukd like to commit .
It can be helpful if you would like to reset your changes .
