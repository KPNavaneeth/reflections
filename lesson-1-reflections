1) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
A)This helped to detect the typo error and can also be used to compare large files.

2)How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
A)This can help to keep track of the previous files that did not have an error and also debug my code easily. 

3)What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
A)Then files may not get saved when many logical changes are done . WHereas this does not happen in manual saving .

4)Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
A)This is because there are other files required for the saved file to function properly.

5)How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
A)We can go to the particular repository and type git log to know the list of commits and using git diff to know the insertions and the deletions.

6)How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
A)Since we have saved more than one versions of the file we can make changes that could break something without losing the entire code.

7)Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
A)I want to use git for further programming purposes containing large files.
